# Methods for Adding CSS
practice adding CSS to an HTML file using all three methods: external CSS, internal CSS, and inline CSS. 
- use only type selectors when adding styles via the external and internal methods. 
- use only keywords for colors (e.g. "blue")

There are three elements for you to add styles to, each of which uses a different method of adding CSS to it

The properties you need to add to each element are:

* 
* `p`: (internal) a green background, white text, and a font size of 18px
* `button`: (inline) an orange background and a font size of 18px
