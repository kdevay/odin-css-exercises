one of the class names is shared. 
do not add any styles to them.

The properties you need to add to each element are:

.avatar,
.proportioned {
    width: 300px;
    height: 100%;
}
classes 300 pixels wide, then give it a height so that it retains its original square proportions (don't hardcode in a pixel value for the height!).
.avatar,
.distorted {
    width: 200px;
    height: 400px;
}

## Desired Outcome

### Self Check
- Did you properly chain class selectors for each rule?
- Does the `proportioned` image retain its original square proportions?
- Does the `distorted` image end up looking squished and, well, distorted?
