# The Holy Grail of Layout

[Holy Grail](https://www.google.com/search?q=holy+grail+layout&tbm=isch&sclient=img) 

### Hints
- change the flex-direction to push the footer down.
- add some divs 
- use flex-wrap to align the cards.
-  Must define the cards' dimensions for `flex-wrap` to work.

## Desired outcome

The number of cards in the grid is based on the width of your screen.


### Self Check
- header text 
    font-size: 32px;
    font-weight: 900px;
    margin: 16px;
    (vertically centered)

- The footer 
    may go below_the screen bottom if the content overflows
    is centered horizontally and vertically.
- The sidebar and cards take up all available space above the footer.
- The sidebar 
    padding: 16px;
    width: 300px; (fixed width)
    links: font-size: 24px;  color:white;  text decoration: none;

- There is 32px padding around the 'cards' section.
- The cards are arranged horizontally, but wrap to multiple lines when they run out of room on the page.
