# A common 'modal' style
edit the HTML a bit to get everything where it needs to be.

### A hint
may revisit the `flex-shrink` to keep a flex item from getting smashed.

## Desired outcome

![desired outcome](./desired-outcome.png)

### Self Check

- blue icon aligned left.
- equal space on all sides of the icon 
- padding around the edge of the modal.
- The header, text, and buttons are aligned with each other.
- The header is bold and a slightly larger text-size than the text.
- The close button is vertically aligned with the header, and aligned in the top-right of the card.
