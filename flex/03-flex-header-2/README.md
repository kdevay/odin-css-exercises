# Another common header style

- edit the HTML to separate the left and right items.
- 8px space between everything and the edge of the header.
- 16px between each item on left and right sides.
- Everything is centered vertically inside the header.

## Desired outcome
As with the last example, this one needs to be flexible in the middle, with items pushed to the left and right.


### Self Check
- Everything is centered vertically inside the header.
- flex is used to arrange everything.
